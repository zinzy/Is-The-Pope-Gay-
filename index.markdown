## You know, that is actually a really great question! 

With regards to the hot-button, politically-charged topic of "same sex attraction", or more appropriately "sexual and gender diversity", one has to wonder:

## Where does Pope Francis rank on the Kinsey scale?!

Well, We The Queer Catholic Community have conducted thorough research into the matter. 

After thousands of conversations, ethnographic studies, literature review, in-depth study of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, our expert opinion is that:

## It really doesn't matter.

Sexual and gender diversity do not inform dignity. They do not affect worth. They do not determine fate. They do not inspire evil.

Sexual and gender diversity do not take away our ability to live lives through which we seek to treat our neighbors as ourselves.

## Go forth and learn:
